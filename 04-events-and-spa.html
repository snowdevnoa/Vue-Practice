            <!-- 3. We need to change the content whenever we click on these links
            so we need to set up a click event for these links
                some what reminiscient to DOM level zero events
                og way to set up events was in html with attributes i.e. onclick="[function]", onhover="[function]""
                with Vue, we use a vue directive: v-on

                v-on: + [name of event]
                i.e. v-on:click, v-on:mouseenter   there is a shorthand, you can use @ sign so @click=""
              

            -->
            <a
              class="nav-link"
              v-bind:href="page.link.url"
              :title="`This link goes to the ${page.link.text} page`"
              v-on:click.prevent="activePage = index"
              >{{page.link.text}}
            </a>
            <!--4. whenever we click on the link we need to be able to track of the page that we clicked on
            
                5. Because the href is there, if you click on a link, it will navigate to the url which we don't want.
                    We could prevent it from happening if this was a normal DOM event listener using the event object's
                    preventDefault() method

                    with Vue, we have a more declarative way of doing that. Whenever we specify the @click directive, we can
                    follow it up with the v-on: + [name of event] + .prevent

                    so v-on:click.prevent

                    prevent default method basically says we want to prevent the browser from navigating to the href when user clicks on the link

        data() {
          return {
            // 4. Initialize this as our home page and tracked base on our index as far as the pages goes below
            activePage: 0,

            // 1. There are three pages of content we must create so makes sense to do an array of pages
            pages: [
              {
                link: { text: 'Home', url: 'index.html' },
                pageTitle: 'Home Page',
                content: 'This is home content',
              },
              {
                link: { text: 'About', url: 'about.html' },
                pageTitle: 'About Page',
                content: 'This is about content',
              },
              {
                link: { text: 'Contact', url: 'contact.html' },
                pageTitle: 'Contact Page',
                content: 'This is contact content',

<!-- We no longer have to write the code that actually changes the content, instead all we have to do is change data.
    and then our application will react to that change in data. The only piece of data we changed, was the value of activePage 
    Whenever we click on a link, it changed that value. Because of that very simple change, Vue automatically updated the content that was 
    loaded in the DOM because our code said to load the page title of the active page and to load the cotent of the active page.

    all we have to do was set up the UI to display the content and change the data aka change he state, 
    and Vue will automatically update the DOM for us
