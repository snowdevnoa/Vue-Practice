      create a vue application by using the Vue object from the vue library
      and a method called 'createApp' and thus its called a vue instance
     
      Vue.createApp() // cool thing is that we can have multiple view instance in a single web page
        .mount('#content'); // use the mount method specify html element we want to mount this, uses a css selector
      BTS 
    since we have mounted our application with this div element with the id of content what
        we have inside of the div element is a TEMPlATE. and vue is going to use this template
        in order to generate what we see inside the browser

        right now our template is hard coded html.
        However we want to soft code this, we want to provide data to the application so we can
        view them in our template.

        So we do this by passing what we call "options" in the createApp() method.
        The "options" is nothing but an object, and the properties are well. . . options

    */
      Vue.createApp({
        /*first option is a data option. this provides data to the application
            data() is a funciton that returns an object. In React this is similar and referred to as 'state'
        */
        data() {
          return {
            pageTitle: 'Hello, Vue', //use {{property name}} in html to display value
            content: 'Welcome to the wonderful world of view'
          };
        },
      }).mount('#content');
