    <!-- Navbar
    3. SUPER IMPORTANT to remember to use the vue bind directive or it'll pass literal strings

      let's just imagine if we didn't bind active-page, it would mean that we are still using the numeric value we set which is 0

      DATA FLOWS FROM PARENT TO CHILD
      meaning that the app in the script is the parent, and the child is the navbar component

      so if we didn't bind the v-bind:active-page="activePage"
      was just active-page="activePage"
      
      then the data activePage was initialized as 0
      active-page="0"


      so the next time activePage is updatd, that change is not gonna be passed down to navbar because it is not bound so it will stay as 0

      SO IF U WANT THE CHILD COMPONENT TO UPDATE BASED UPON THE DATA IT IS PROVIDED SO U NEED TO BIND THE DATA TO THOSE PROPS


    9. For example we talked about the click event
    (v-on:)@click="[function name or code to execute]"


    well in this particular case click is essentially a prop, a special prop because it is an event.
    We can eventually do the same thing with our own attribute

    :nav-link-click="(index)=> activePage"
     
    <navbar 
    v-bind:pages="pages" 
    v-bind:active-page="activePage"
    :nav-link-click="(index)=> activePage = index"
    ></navbar>
    
    Remember that since we are on the navbar component, we are inside the APP NOT the NAVBAR so "(index)=> activePage = index" is for the application

    Go to step 10

    -->
    <navbar
      v-bind:pages="pages"
      v-bind:active-page="activePage"
      :nav-link-click="(index)=> activePage = index"
    ></navbar>
    <!--  -->
    <page-viewer v-bind:page="pages[activePage]"></page-viewer>
    <script>
      let app = Vue.createApp({
        data() {
          return {
            activePage: 0,
            /*
            theme: 'light',

            4. We can remove the theme since it is specific to the navbar so we can take that out of the app
            and we can define it as part of the data of the navbar, go to step 5

            */
            pages: [
              {
                link: { text: 'Home', url: 'index.html' },
                pageTitle: 'Home Page',
                content: 'This is home content',
              },
              {
                link: { text: 'About', url: 'about.html' },
                pageTitle: 'About Page',
                content: 'This is about content',
              },
              {
                link: { text: 'Contact', url: 'contact.html' },
                pageTitle: 'Contact Page',
                content: 'This is contact content',
              },
            ],
          };
        },

        /* 6. The same is true to our method, specific to the navbar so add the methods option to the component
        methods: {
          changeTheme() {
            if (this.theme == 'light') {
              this.theme = 'dark';
            } else {
              this.theme = 'light';
            }
          },
        },
        */
      });

      app.component('page-viewer', {
        props: ['page'],
        template: `
          <div class="container">
            <h1>{{page.pageTitle}}</h1>
            <p>{{page.content}}</p>
          </div>
          `,
      });

      app.component('navbar', {
        /*2. Define the props that it needs.
        
        it needs the pages to generate the a elements for the links and the active page
        
        recommend to keep the same name from the data because
        remember props are alot like paramters on a function. these are variables we use inside of our template


       8. Up to this point, everything looks good on localhost EXCEPT when you click on the nav links, nothing happens.
       The reason is very simple, we are not updating the activePage. Now if you look at the template, you
       see the v-on directive does have an event listener to see the activePage change.

       HOWEVER, props are READ ONLY. So we can't change their value INSIDE of components.

       Remember that data flows from parent to child, so if we were to change the value of a prop inside of a child, the parent 
       would not know the value changed because data flows from parent to child.

       So how do we do the reverse aka how can a child notify a parent that something changes.

      solution: We use an EVENT or essentally an EVENT



        
        */
        props: ['pages', 'activePage', 'navLinkClick'],

        /*1. Cut and paste the nav element to create the next component

        The template are gonna use backticks in order to delimit this string. However we already
        are using the js template strings inside of this template so that means we need to ESCAPE thosee backticks in the elements
        
        This is one of the reasons why when we get into components it makes sense to use build tools and toolchain because
        when you start using JSX you don't need to do anything like this
        

        10. all we need to do is change where we click on the a element
          two things we need to do:
          first define prop called navLinkClick and it is a function that will pass in the index in the a element click

          SO it works alot like an event.
          
          The parent is supplying the function to navLinkClick that the child is going to execute, the child is going to pass the index back 
          so that inside of the application, we can update activePage to that index value.
