        class="navbar-toggler"
        type="button"
        data-toggle="collapse"

              2. you would think putting href="{{link.url}}" would work
                BUT nope
                what we want to do is use a vue DIRECTIVE again called
                
                'v-bind' + ':[attribute name]'
                
                the colon followed by the html attribute to bind the value to
                and then the value, is just a js expression so DOES NOT NEED {{}}
                so below v-bind:href="link.url"
            -->
            <a
              class="nav-link"
              v-bind:href="link.url"
              :title="`This link goes to the ${link.text} page`"
              :key="index"
              >{{link.text}}
            </a>

            <!-- 3. binding data to an attribute is VERY very common so sometimes
                    you will find in the majority of projects something like this:
                    
                    :href="link.url"
                    
                    you don't even need the v-bind directive, just the colon and attribute name
                    we can do this for any html attribute i.e.

                    :title="`This link goes to the ${link.text} page`"

                    remember that binding the attribute turns the value into js so use `` es6 syntax


              4. one other thing that's not important right now,
              because the data that we are providing our navbar is STATIC. We aren't changing our data
              HOWEVER, when we do change that data, Vue is going to automatically change what is seen inside of the browser
              we don't have to do anything.
              BUT we do need to HELP VUE so that it can identify which object that it needs to update
              so we need to provide a key or a unique identifier for each one of the li elements that we are
              generating above with the V4 directive so we do that by v-binding a key so

              "v-bind:key" or ":key"

              and this has to be a UNIQUE value for EACH li element that is generated or a better way of thinking about it is
              a unique identifier for each item in the links array. One thing that is unique is the INDEX of the elements so
              we could use the index for the key.

              this is strictly for helping vue
